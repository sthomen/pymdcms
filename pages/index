# It Worked!

You've successfully installed this Content Management System! Click [here](page "Another page") to see another page or [here](test "Test app") to see a test app.

Configuration is done through the cms.conf file, and you simply tell it where
to look for markdown pages

	[pages]
	path = pages

These pages can specify metadata at the start of the page, rewriting almost
all variables sent to the template engine, including changing the template
used through a simple key/value pair at the start of the markdown file.

The CMS can also hand over control to an app, again given the ability to
override almost everything.

	[apps]
	test = apps.test.Test

The system looks for the class Test in apps.test (apps/test.py) and attaches it
at /test, instantiates it once and on every call runs
`<class>.dispatch(args, kwargs)` with the path arguments in args and the query
string/post values in kwargs.
